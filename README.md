Insurance Premium Analysis Project
This project focuses on analyzing insurance premiums to provide actionable insights into customer behavior, premium trends, and factors influencing premium amounts. The analysis was conducted using Power BI, leveraging its advanced visualization and analytical capabilities to create an interactive dashboard.

Key Features of the Dashboard
Sum of Premium vs Vehicle Age:

Displays how the insurance premium amount correlates with the age of the vehicle.
Shows variations, indicating whether older or newer vehicles tend to have higher premiums.
Total Premium Metrics:

The dashboard prominently highlights total premiums collected, including:
Total Premium Amount: $1.16 billion.
Sum of Premiums Analyzed: 622 million units.
Sum of Premium by Customer Feedback:

Visualizes how customer satisfaction levels (e.g., Poor, Average, Good) influence premium collection.
Helps identify patterns where better feedback aligns with higher premium contributions.
Sum of Premium vs Number of Dependents:

Shows the impact of the number of dependents on premium amounts.
Observes trends like a sharp increase for certain dependent categories.
Sum of Premium vs Location:

Analyzes premium variations across different residential locations (Urban, Suburban, Rural).
Useful for geographic segmentation in marketing and pricing strategies.
Sum of Premium vs Gender:

A pie chart highlights the distribution of premium amounts between genders, with:
Males contributing $574.93 million.
Females contributing $581.11 million.
Provides a gender-specific view of premium collections.
Sum of Premium vs Marital Status:

A bar chart depicts premium amounts across marital statuses (Single, Married, Divorced).
Identifies customer segments with higher contributions based on their marital status.
Objectives of the Analysis
To identify key factors that influence insurance premiums.
To segment the customer base based on demographic, geographic, and behavioral insights.
To assist insurers in developing targeted policies and improving customer retention through data-driven strategies.
Insights and Recommendations
Vehicle Age: Younger vehicles seem to have higher premiums; insurers could focus marketing efforts on newer vehicle owners.
Customer Feedback: Positive feedback aligns with increased premiums; investing in customer satisfaction programs may enhance revenue.
Dependents: The spike in premiums for specific dependent numbers suggests tailoring products for families with multiple dependents.
Location Trends: Urban areas show slightly higher premiums; potential exists for rural-specific offerings.
Gender and Marital Status: Gender and marital status provide valuable segmentation criteria, allowing insurers to personalize products.
